# JaMaBuild: Mass Building of Java Projects

JaMaBuild is a tool that takes a list of Java projects as an input and tries to build all of them using Maven or Gradle. It can be used for the creation of software engineering research corpora (e.g., JAR files for static analysis) or for research about build tools.

The tool supports various project sources (local, Git, GitHub), exclusion criteria (e.g., Android projects), artifact collection methods (resulting JAR files, build logs), and other configuration options.

More details will be added soon.
